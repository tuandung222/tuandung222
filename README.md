## üíº Professional Experience

### AI Research and Development Engineer
**Dien Toan Group** | Jul 2024 - Apr 2025 | Tan Binh District, HCM City
- Pretrained a multilingual vision-language backbone (Vietnamese/English/Chinese) for Text-based Person Re-identification on a large-scale dataset (36 million image-text pairs) using 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs
- Pretrained/Fine-tuned models for Text-based Person Re-identification using custom PyTorch implementation without relying on high-level training frameworks
- Collaborated with Deployment Engineers to optimize models in ONNX/Tensor-RT format and deploy them to production using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
- Designed and documented the data annotation workflow, evaluating tools like CVAT and Label Studio to streamline the dataset preparation process
- Extended the original English pretraining datasets by adding Chinese and Vietnamese captioning annotations, demonstrating that multilingual pretraining improves zero-shot retrieval performance by over 1.2% Rank-1
- Leveraged advanced LLMs and MLLMs with optimized inference frameworks (vLLM, lmdeploy, SGLang) to accelerate data augmentation, enhancing dataset diversity and quality for improved model performance

### AI Researcher
**Dien Toan Group** | Oct 2023 - Jun 2024 | Tan Binh District, HCM City

- Preprocessed realistic surveillance video data using OpenCV and FFmpeg for frame extraction, noise reduction, and format standardization
- Evaluated multiple efficient data annotation tools for creating high-quality tracking training datasets
- Optimized Trackformers by modifying architecture/loss to extend from single-class (human-only) to multi-class tracking and mitigate class imbalance, where pedestrian instances significantly outnumbered vehicles in the dataset
- Demonstrated real-time system performance in multiple real-world environments, including a technical presentation at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)

### Research Assistant
**Data Science Lab, CSE Faculty, HCMUT** | Aug 2023 - Feb 2025 | District 10, HCM City
